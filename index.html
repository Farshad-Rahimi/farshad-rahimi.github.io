      I earned a B.S. Degree in Robotic Engineering in 2015 and an M.S. ‎Degree in Electrical (Control) Engineering in 2018, from Hamedan ‎University of Technology and Sahand University of Technology, Iran, ‎respectively.
         My academic journey began with my thesis, which focused ‎on distributed optimization for the formation control of a team of mobile ‎robots. 
         This experience exposed me to the fundamental concepts of ‎optimization and estimation in multi-agent systems. 
         
In addition to my academic pursuits, I worked as a self-employed ‎instructor, teaching subjects such as Matlab and LaTeX through online ‎courses. Since 2019, I have also been engaged in independent ‎research.
         
My current research interests encompass distributed optimization, game ‎theory, fault tolerance, and learning, all with a focus on their applications ‎in the fields of mobile robots and autonomous systems.‎
